## Quick Start

1. Upload your dataset or choose from available datasets
2. Select a pre-trained model or define custom architecture
3. Configure training parameters
4. Start training on available GPU nodes
5. Monitor training progress and metrics
6. Deploy trained model for inference

## Pricing

Training costs depend on:
